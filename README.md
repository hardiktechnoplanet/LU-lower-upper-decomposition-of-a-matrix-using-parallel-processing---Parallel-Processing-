# LU-lower-upper-decomposition-of-a-matrix-using-parallel-processing---Parallel-Processing-
The code determines the the determinant of a given n x n matrix by performing LU decomposition.
The matrix is divided among the processors and the computation is done on the basis on 2D Mesh topology. 
Firstly, the LU decomposition is performed.
Secondly, the matrix determinant is calculated. 
Main code file and the pbs file is uploaded. 
The number of processors and the nodes are selected in the pbs file.
